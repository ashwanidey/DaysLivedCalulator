# DaysLivedCounter
The application or program calculates how many days a person survived in this world. It takes two inputs from the user and those are dates and use algorithms/functions to calculate the difference between those dates.
The application is simple to use and has a very basic code structure. The user can simply use it as a calculator where he inputs just two dates and gets the result.
It is a TUI (Texted Based User Interface) and can be used from terminal itself. There  are no GUI (Graphical Based User Interface) and backend involved as such in this project.
Software requirement analysis and design has been further explained in the report
Program has been tested with multiple test cases and has succeed in its implementation phase.
